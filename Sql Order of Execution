Sql Order of Execution

Intitially we select which table we need to work on with using "From" command,which directly says from whic table,
which can also be co-used with "Join" functioned, the initial table we select for 
the "join" function will be priortized with all the rows presented from hat specific
selected table with selected coloumns.(This works "left join" but doesn't make a difference
with "inner join") The select function when using "Joins" needs formatted like :
SELECT store_3290.Customer_id , store_3290.Dept_id with the table with coloumn included.

Next we can use "where" function to filter the output as needed with the help of 
conditions like name withing inverted commas along with coloumn name like:
WHERE Country='Mexico'; also can be used along with (AND, OR and NOT)

Next is the "group by" function which helps to work on the repeated data on the
coloumns and populate the output together rather than multiple repeated same data.
Also whatever coloumn in "group by" function needs to be present in "select" and vice-versa

Next is "having" functions which can aggregate data with aggregation functions.

Next we select the coloumns that we needs to be populated by the help of 
"Select" command, this is to select data from the database.
Next is aggregation functions which can be used in Select functions like MAX(Marks).

Next is "Order by" which helps to sort the output data like : ORDER BY Country DESC;
this has default ascending mode.

Finally at last we can use "Limit" function to limit data.
