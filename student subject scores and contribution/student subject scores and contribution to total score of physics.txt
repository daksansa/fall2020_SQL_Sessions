--From table "stud_subject_marks" find each student's physics score's contribution to the total score of all 
--three subjects.

SELECT stud_subject_marks.student_id , stud_subject_marks.subject , 
stud_subject_marks.marks, x.total_marks,(stud_subject_marks.marks*100)/x.total_marks as contribution
FROM (SELECT student_id ,SUM(marks)as total_marks

First tried to get the data to sum all the marks for every subject for each student and named it as "x"
Table "x" will have all the total marks obtained by every student

The we tried to use inner joined table "x" with base table "stud_subject_marks" to 
get the student id , subjects, marks and total marks obtained by every student, since this helps with aggregation to find the contribution.

For this inner join we used " on stud_subject_marks.student_id = x.student_id " for the ON condition to filter, since both table "x" as well as 
table " stud_subject_marks " has column "student_id" in common.

To be more specific to find subject "physics" contribution towards the total marks obtained by a student we used " WHERE subject = 'Physics' "
