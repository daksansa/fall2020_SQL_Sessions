q3

Stores undergo renovation in some quarters.
Under the renovation period, stores are shut down and no sales figures are reported.
One store is closed down for exactly on quarter and not more. 
Those records would be missing from the table.
Again there are 100 unique stores and 4 quarters. 
But instead of the ideal 400 records, this time there are lesser records.
Find out such missing quarters for each store

Method I

--SELECT store,(10-SUM(quarters)) as Missing_Quarters
--from store_missing_q_csv
--group by store;



Method II

select store,Missing_Quarter
FROM 
(
SELECT *,
--Using case when for finding missing quarters with various criteria's
CASE
WHEN quarter = 1 and nxt_q = 3 THEN 2
WHEN quarter = 2 and nxt_q = 4 THEN 3
WHEN quarter = 3 and nxt_q IS NULL THEN 4
WHEN quarter = 2 and nxt_q=3 and previous_q is null THEN 1
    ELSE 0
END AS Missing_Quarter
FROM ( select store, quarter,
LEAD(quarter,1) OVER (
	PARTITION by store 
		ORDER BY quarter
--Used lead to create a column for next data from specified base column's adjacent cell value
	) nxt_q,
LAG(quarter,1) OVER (
	PARTITION by store 
		ORDER BY quarter
--Used lag to create a column for previous data from specified base column's adjacent cell value
	) previous_q
FROM 
	q3
	) Final
	) Main_Q_table
--used !=0 filter data to find missing quarters only  
	where Missing_Quarter!= 0;
